This code is an implementation of the RSA algorithm, which encrypts a message.
In this code, all you need to do is change the 'Text' string and remove the line that assigns values to q and p (they were given as an example that the program works).
In this code, you can add a method that asks the user for a message and encrypts it by simply assigning the 'text' variable to this message.
